# 1. Devise an experiment to verify that the list index operator is 𝑂(1)

# 2. Devise an experiment to verify that get item and set item are 𝑂(1) for dictionaries.

# 3. Devise an experiment that compares the performance of the del operator on lists and dictionaries.

# 4. Given a list of numbers in random order, write an algorithm that works in 𝑂(𝑛log(𝑛)) to find the kth smallest number in the list.

# 5. Can you improve the algorithm from the previous problem to be linear? Explain
